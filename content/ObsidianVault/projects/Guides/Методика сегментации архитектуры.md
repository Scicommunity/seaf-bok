| Business Architecture                  | Focuses on business motivations and business operations, linking customers, products, services, finances, suppliers, and partners. The linkages, relationships, and operational aspects are elaborated using the Enterprise’s goals, objectives, strategies, business processes, and capabilities along with its rules and controls.                                                           |
| Security Architecture                  | An approach that clearly addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply controls to eliminate or mitigate the barriers to attain the objectives, including sustainability and continuity of business.                                                                                                  |
| Service Architecture                   | An approach to describe the purpose and method of interaction to get an outcome for the buyer/user. Includes clear articulation of the service availability, location, access control, response expectations, and usage methods.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Human Machine Interaction Architecture | An approach to study and optimize the effort and understanding required by humans to work with machines and applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Information Systems Architecture       | This is a logical grouping describing processes that are automated. The description includes information accessed and produced, infrastructure used to host applications that automates the processes, communicates across applications, or stores information. This is composed of all information, data, application, infrastructure, communications, and integration architectures.         |
| Information Architecture               | A structural design and approach to help users (humans and machines) understand where data (text, audio, video, binaries) is, how to find it, what to expect, and how to use it to improve quality of decisions.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Data Architecture                      | A description of policies, rules, or standards that govern which data is collected, how it is stored, arranged, integrated, and put to use. Organization of data is normally expressed in models.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Application Architecture               | Describes the behavior of a solution (automated or manual) applied to solve a business problem, how the solution interacts with other such solutions, and its users. It also describes how the solutions are organized, including its structural and behavioral elements.                                                                                                                      |
| Infrastructure Architecture            | A description of elements without which core business operations cannot take place. In generic terms, includes buildings and space for parking, power supply, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, dining area and restrooms (in other words facilities). In the information technology context, covers bare metal computing devices like servers, routers, switches, and disks. |
| Communications Architecture            | A network of people and machines that connects separate components of an organization. The primary focus of this architecture is to enable flow of information across the organization and rest of the world. Normally includes telephony, video conferencing, and automated response systems.                                                                                                 |
| Integration Architecture               | A description of tools and techniques applied to enable applications to interact with each other using appropriate communications and infrastructure architecture. Its focus is on setting rules of engagement between applications including protocols and method, compliant with risk and security architecture.                                                                             |
